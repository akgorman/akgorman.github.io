## Academics
Hello! My name is Annie Gorman and I am a second-year Master of Public Health student at Columbia University, where I study Epidemiology with a Certificate in Applied Biostatistics. I am interested in infectious disease epidemiology and employing statistical methods to better understand disease spread and prevention. 

My background preceding my studies at Columbia includes a BS in Public Health from The University of Maryland. Go Terps!

I am currently a Teaching Assistant for Research Methods and Applications: Quantitative Foundations, a Core class for all first-year Columbia MPH students. Each week, I lead a lab discussing introductory epidemiology and biostatistics concepts. 


## Career 
I am interested in a career in the fields of infectious disease, vaccine development, and epidemiologic/biostatistical research within the biotechnology field. Additionally, I am passionate about using quantitative methods and real-world evidence to inform decision making in pharmaceutical development.

I spent this past summer in Cambridge, MA, as an Infectious Disease Epidemiology Intern at Moderna. There, I performed epidemiologic analysis and disease surveillance, as well as wrote an early clinical development study protocol for the Respiratory Vaccines team. I strengthened my data and statistical analysis, literature review, and scientific writing skills. 

Please head over to my [resume page]() for more specific information detailing my background.
